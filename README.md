## About this Repo  

this repo is my collection of notes, code snippets, and experiments while learning and practicing machine learning.  
it’s not a polished textbook, it’s more like my study journal → written in my style with examples.  

the goal:  
- keep track of important ML concepts.  
- explain things in a way that even beginners can follow.  
- have runnable code snippets for practice.

## Map of Topics  

this repo is organized into note files (markdown) that cover different ML topics step by step.  
think of it like a growing handbook — I’ll keep adding more over time.
