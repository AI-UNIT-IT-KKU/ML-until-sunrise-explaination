## About this Repo  

this repo is my collection of notes, code snippets, and experiments while learning and practicing machine learning.  
it’s not a polished textbook, it’s more like my study journal → written in my style with examples.  

the goal:  
- keep track of important ML concepts.  
- explain things in a way that even beginners can follow.  
- have runnable code snippets for practice.

## Map of Topics  

this repo is organized into note files (markdown) that cover different ML topics step by step.  
think of it like a growing handbook — I’ll keep adding more over time.

2. [Part 2 – Regression] 
3. [Part 3 – Classification]
4. [Part 4 – Clustering]
5. [Part 5 – Association Rule Learning] 
6. [Part 6 – Reinforcement Learning]
7. [Part 7 – Natural Language Processing]  
8. [Part 8 – Deep Learning]  
9. [Part 9 – Dimensionality Reduction] 
10. [Part 10 – Model Selection and Boosting]
